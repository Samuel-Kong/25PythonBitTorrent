# 25PythonBitTorrent
Self-initiated coding project to make a Python BitTorrent client

First, I made a `.sh` file to download all packages/modules from in `requirements.txt`

Then, I made the `.sh` file run `main.py`

I then learnt from [this tutorial](https://markuseliasson.se/article/bittorrent-in-python/) and several online videos regarding how to make the BitTorrent

Because I don't usually torrent stuff online, this is just a idea of how it should work and I have not tested it on anything
